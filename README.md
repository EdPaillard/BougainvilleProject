# BougainvilleProject
Bougainville is an ambitious cultural project which aims to bring together text, picture and video to tell the incredible and famous tale of Captain Hautbrave in his exploration and discoveries of deep space, astonishing planets, and foreign cultures


## First personnal project
Main reason of my reconversion form History teacher to informatician, this project reflects, of course, the very first step of a self-learning debutant. No framework here, it's pure html, css and JavaScript. I barely understood one or two things about backend. Still, the adventure begins here !

### How to start HTML/CSS website ?
In case you're wondering :

- Install the packages

```
npm install
```

- Launch the server
```
node server
```

# Thanks !
